"Why are the quiz levels and monster levels different?" Explanation
When everyone works hard on quizzes to level up, the monster's level also increases. But—
The quiz level (per subject) and the monster's level (overall power) do not match the same
numbers. The reason is...
1. The monster's level is the "total level"!
Monsters' levels are calculated by combining the results of many different quizzes,
each contributing a little bit.
Examples include:
 Building quizzes
 Event quizzes
 Antonyms quizzes
 Location quizzes
 School event quizzes
...and so on.
All of these results are combined to determine the monster's level.
2. Each quiz has a different "weight" (importance)!
There are both easy quizzes (S) and difficult quizzes (M).
Difficult quizzes contribute more points to the monster's level than easier ones.
So, even if you get the same “Level 5” score, the impact on the monster is different
between S and M quizzes.
3. The total level is "adjusted"!
The monster’s level is slightly adjusted to ensure the total points result in a balanced
level. This helps to:
 Prevent levels from rising too quickly
 Prevent levels from rising too slowly
 Maintain balance when new quizzes are added
4. Therefore, "quiz levels" and "monster levels" are separate things!
✔ Quiz level → Ability per subject
✔ Monster level → Overall power + growth balance
Even if the quiz level is high, the monster is designed to grow slowly and steadily.
Summary:
 Quiz level → Test scores

 Monster level → Total power (weighted)
Even though the numbers are different, everyone is still getting stronger!



// Set one high enough value so total = 5
// monthsMlevelr has a 0.5 multiplier → 10 × 0.5 = 5
localStorage.setItem('monthsMlevelr', '10');

// Reload to apply
location.reload();
